This repository contains my solutions to four Codewars challenges, all implemented in Python. The goal of this assignment was to practice fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals,
string manipulation, iteration, and built-in Python functions, then to publish the completed solutions in a GitHub repository. All solutions pass the official Codewars test cases. These were my very first CodeWars 
challenges, the setup was a little hard to understand at first but once I got it I was hooked for a little while. Codewars is a fun way to practice code and I look forward to advancing to higher levels and working 
with more difficult code.
